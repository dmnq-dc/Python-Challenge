# Python-Challenge
Module 3 Challenge

Background
In this assignment, using the concepts learned, complete two Python challenges: PyBank and PyPoll. Both tasks present a real-world situation where newly developed Python scripting skills come in handy.

PyBank Instructions
    In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyse the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". The task is to create a Python script that analyses the records to calculate each of the following values: 
    1. The total number of months included in the dataset
    2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    3. The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
    4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    5. The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

PyPoll Instructions
    In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural U.S. town modernise its vote-counting process.
You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

    1. The total number of votes cast
    2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
    3. The percentage of votes each candidate won
    4. The total number of votes each candidate won
    5. The winner of the election based on popular vote

Hints and Considerations:
Consider what you've learned so far. You've learned how to import modules like csv. You’ve learned how to read and write files in various formats. You’ve learned how to store content in variables, lists, and dictionaries. You’ve learned how to iterate through basic data structures. And you’ve learned how to debug along the way. Using all that you've learned, try to break down your tasks into discrete mini-objectives.
